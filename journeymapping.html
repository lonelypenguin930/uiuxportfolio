                <p class="story-description">The story started with my own experience. I often found myself with only a few days to clear my room, and I had to throw away many items â€“ books, clothes, decorations, and school supplies. Every time i toss my bag of items into the dumpster, I feel terrible. But I had no alternatives. Selling on online marketplaces is too much work for the limited time, local storages are too expensive, and there is only so much stuff I can carry home. I yearn for a solution.</p>

                <p class="story-description"> I conducted bottom-up research with the Brown community, and my concerns were shared by others. I found that students are unable to find a better way to allocate their items due to lack of alternatives and shortage of time during the move-out phase. Statistics show that college students on average generate 640 pounds of waste per year, which amounts to 6 million tons in total.</p>

                <p class="story-description">When students clear out of their dorms, they typically have several options -- putting them in the donation box, bringing home, using a third-party storage, tossing in the dumpster. Donation boxes are badly organized, bringing home is subject to space constraints, and storages are too expensive. Most things end up in the dumpster. We envision a better way to take unwanted items from students and reallocate them to the ones in need. </p>

            <div class="story-text">
                <h3 class="story-title">The design thinking process is powerful because it encourages identifying the unmet need and formulating a solution that targets the problem. It is a never-ending and self-refining process that requires discipline and committment. I will take my skills and experience during the UnBox project to find bigger problems, and build better solutions.</h3>
