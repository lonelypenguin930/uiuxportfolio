I wanted to contribute to the fans community by creating a player database tracking goals, assists, and a score I assign myself that evaluate a player's performance. Users can create their own teams on the web app and see how strong their squad is.</h3>

                <p class="story-description">The journey started with my own passion. My friends and I often get together to watch games and talk about soccer. I wanted to create an fun way for them to interact with my interpretation of the world cup. I talked to them and my intramural teammates, and it seems like something worth the time and effort.</p>

                <p class="story-description">The vision is simple: a database with key stats that allow users to create a squad out of a pool of players. I handpicked a number of players to populate the database, and based on my own judgement, I assigned them with a fantasy score that reflects their recent performance.</p>

I then turned the journey into a storyboard that illustrates the process. I want the story to both capture the specifics of Eric's personal journey, but also representative enough to capture similar users like Eric.</p>

                <h3 class="story-title">The design thinking process starts with empathizing, and this project is centered around that. Through taking to real people on the streets, I was able to learn how to craft and ask objective questions, questions that offer insights and minimizes biases. This lesson will come in handy in my own design and entrepreneurial journeys.</h3>
